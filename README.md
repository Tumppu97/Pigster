Most notable scripts from my first Unity game "Pigster" which I published on the App Store and Google Play in December 2022.
PlayerMovement2.cs is the main file which handles most of the logic during gameplay.

The game is still available on my phone which I will gladly show in interviews.
Due to not working on the project anymore it has been taken down from both platforms.


Apple because I didn't renew my license.
Android due to outdated user data policy.
