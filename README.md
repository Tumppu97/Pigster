Most notable scripts from my first Unity game "Pigster" which I published on the App Store and Google Play in December 2022.
PlayerMovement2.cs is the main file which handles most of the logic during gameplay.
There are many things I would do differently, especially PlayerMovement2.cs requires a lot of refactoring and most of the file
is hard to read and manage. However, since I am not working on the game anymore it's a wasted effort.

The game is still available on my phone which I will gladly show in interviews.

Due to not working on the project anymore it has been taken down from both platforms.
Apple because I didn't renew my developer license.
Android due to outdated user data policy.
